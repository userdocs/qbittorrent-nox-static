## 🚀 Quick Start

### Quick Install

> [!NOTE]
>
> `qi.bash`: The quick installer supports Alpine or Debian like systems.

Latest release using libtorrent `v2`

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/refs/heads/master/qi.bash)
```

Latest release using libtorrent `v1.2`

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/refs/heads/master/qi.bash) -lt v1

Using Libtorrent v1.2 and forcing the armv7 binary

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/refs/heads/master/qi.bash) -lt v1 -fa armv7
```

Show the help section

## 🔍 Overview

The `qbittorrent-nox-static` project provides a bash build script that compiles static `qbittorrent-nox` binaries using the latest available dependencies from their source. These statically linked binaries offer several advantages:

- **Universal compatibility**: Run on any Linux distribution with matching CPU architecture
- **No dependencies**: All required libraries are statically linked
- **Latest versions**: Built with the most recent stable releases of all dependencies
- **Multiple architectures**: Support for x86, x86_64, ARM variants

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **Static compilation** - No external dependencies required
- 🏗️ **Multi-architecture support** - x86, x86_64, armhf, armv7, aarch64
- 📦 **Latest dependencies** - Always built with current stable versions
- 🔄 **Automated builds** - CI/CD pipeline ensures fresh releases
- 🛡️ **Build attestation** - Cryptographically signed provenance
- 📊 **Version tracking** - JSON metadata for dependency versions

## 📦 Installation

Choose the command that matches your system architecture:

### x86 (32-bit Intel/AMD)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/x86-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

### x86_64 (64-bit Intel/AMD)

## 🔧 Libtorrent Versions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Libtorrent v1.2** is currently the main branch supported by qBittorrent since the release of [4.4.5](https://www.qbittorrent.org/news.php). However, both v1.2 and v2.0 builds are provided.

This project automatically builds and releases binaries for both Libtorrent versions:

- **Libtorrent v1.2**: Stable and widely supported (recommended)
- **Libtorrent v2.0**: Latest features and improvements

> [!TIP]
> You can view all current releases and pre-releases at <https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/tags>

## 🎯 Version Management

### Getting Version-Specific Releases

Since this project builds both v1.2 and v2.0 simultaneously, you can target specific libtorrent versions using these commands:

#### Libtorrent v1.2 Release Info

```bash
jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_1_2)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json)
```

#### Libtorrent v2.0 Release Info

```bash
jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_2_0)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json)
```

### Build Revisions

The build system tracks 5 main dependencies that trigger automatic rebuilds:

- qBittorrent
- Libtorrent
- Qt
- Boost
- OpenSSL

**Revision Tracking:**

- New releases start at revision `0`
- Incremented by `1` for each rebuild
- Updates to Qt, Boost, or OpenSSL only update existing release assets
- Updates to qBittorrent or Libtorrent create new releases

#### Check Latest Revision

```bash
jq -r '.revision' < <(curl -sL "https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json")
```

#### Track Specific Version Revisions

For independent tracking of v1.2 and v2.0 revisions:

1. **Get the release tag:**

   ```bash
   release="$(jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_1_2)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json))"
   ```

2. **Get the revision for that release:**

   ```bash
   jq -r '.revision' < <(curl -sL "https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/download/${release}/dependency-version.json")
   ```

## 📊 Dependency Tracking

Each release includes a `dependency-version.json` file that provides version information shared across latest and pre-releases. This helps overcome API limitations for consistent access to version data.

### Download Dependency Information

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json
```

### Example Output

```json
{
    "openssl": "3.2.0",
    "boost": "1.84.0",
    "libtorrent_1_2": "1.2.19",
    "libtorrent_2_0": "2.0.9",
    "qt5": "5.15.12",
    "qt6": "6.6.1",
    "qbittorrent": "4.6.2",
    "revision": "3"
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with qBittorrent v5, configure-based builds will be unsupported. Only CMake builds will be available, with Qt6 as the default. Qt5 builds will be considered legacy and eventually dropped.

## 🛡️ Build Attestation

Binaries built from `release-5.0.0_v2.0.10` and `release-5.0.0_v1.2.19` revision `1` onwards use [actions/attest-build-provenance](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance) for cryptographic verification.

### Verify Binary Integrity

You can verify the integrity and provenance of downloaded binaries using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh attestation verify x86_64-qbittorrent-nox -o userdocs
```

### Example Verification Output

```bash
Loaded digest sha256:a656ff57b03ee6218205d858679ea189246caaecbbcc38d4d2b57eb81d8e59bb for file://x86_64-qbittorrent-nox
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
✓ Verification succeeded!
