-   [qbittorrent-nox-static-legacy](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static-legacy) for people who want to use qBittorrent v4.3.9 built against current versions of the remaining dependencies. Libtorrent v1.2 branch only.

## Summary

The `qbittorrent-nox-static` project is a `bash` build script that compiles a static `qbittorrent-nox` binary using the latest available dependencies from their source. These statically linked binaries can run on any matching CPU architecture and are not OS specific. This means you can run a `x86_64` Alpine edge build on any Linux based OS of like CentOS | Fedora | OpenSuse | Debian Stretch | Ubuntu Xenial and more.

## Documentation

🔵 [Visit the documentation](https://userdocs.github.io/qbittorrent-nox-static/#/README) for in depth information on using this project and script usage.

## WSL2

🟢 These static builds can be used on WSL2 and accessed via `localhost:8080` using the download instructions below

## Libtorrent versions

🟠 Libtorrent `v1.2` is currently the main branch supported by qBittorrent since a change with the release of [4.4.5](https://www.qbittorrent.org/news.php)

Libtorrent `v2.0` builds are still released as latest releases as it it does not really matter to this project as it always builds and releases for both `v1.2` and `v2.0`. See the next section for how to get the version you need via the latest release URL.

You can view the current latest and pre releases and tags here.

🔵 <https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases>

## Getting the Version you want via the latest release URL

Since this project builds and releases both v1.2 and v2.0 builds simultaneously we can use the commands below to always get the latest version of the related pre release via the latest release `dependency-version.json` asset.

Using this method it does not matter which version is the latest release or pre release as the commands will provide you the version specific info you need for the twinned latest/pre releases.

For Libtorrent `v1.2`

```bash
jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_1_2)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json)
```

For Libtorrent `v2.0`

```bash
jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_2_0)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json)
```

## Revisions

The build has 5 main dependencies tracked that will trigger a rebuild on an update being available.

-   qBittorrent
-   Libtorrent
-   Qt
-   Boost
-   Openssl

When a new build is triggered for updating `qBittorrent` or `Libtorrent` a new release will be generated as the release tags will be updated.

Since I do not append revision info to tags `Qt` - `Boost` - `Openssl` builds will only update the existing release assets.

To track these revisions you can use this command. All new releases start at a revision of `0` and increment by `1` per revised build.

```bash
jq -r '.revision' < <(curl -sL "https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json")
```

## Dependency json

From `release-4.4.5` each release contains a `dependency-version.json` file that provide some key version information for that is shared across the latest release and the twinned pre release. This helps to overcome some limitations of the API for consistently and directly accessing this information.

Downloading the file like this:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json
```

Will output a result like this:

```json
{
	"qbittorrent": "4.4.5",
	"qt5": "5.15.7",
	"qt6": "6.4.0",
	"libtorrent_1_2": "1.2.18",
	"libtorrent_2_0": "2.0.8",
	"boost": "1.80.0",
	"openssl": "3.0.7",
	"revision": "1"
}
```

As demonstrated above by using the latest release URL we can construct the tag of the twinned pre release and therefore the asset URL with no margin for error.
