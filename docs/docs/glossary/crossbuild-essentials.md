Native [Debian and Ubuntu cross build toolchains](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=crossbuild-essential) for cross compiling, used when a supported Debian based OS is the Host.

---

When building on supported Debian based hosts we use the official crossbuild-essential tool chains that are made specifically for cross compiling on these host operating systems.

On the modern distros like Bullseye and Jammy there is a wide range of supported cross build targets available.

:::caution
Only Bullseye and Jammy onwards have the full range of support we need to match the Alpine host options.
