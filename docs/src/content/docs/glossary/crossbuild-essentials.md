ðŸŸ¦ Native Debian and Ubuntu cross build toolchains for cross compiling, used when a supported Debian based OS is the Host.

When building on supported Debian based hosts we use the official `crossbuild-essential` tool chains that are made specifically for cross compiling on these host operating systems.

On the modern distros like Trixie and Noble there is a wide range of supported cross build targets available.

Please look a the links below to see which options are available for which platform and release.
