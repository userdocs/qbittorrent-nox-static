:::note[Host environment]
The recommended build platform is Alpine Linux and the supported build method is via docker. It will just make things easier.

We do not support a non docker build environment. If you are not using docker, you are on your own.
:::

:::tip[Github Actions]
If you cannot or don't want to use docker, you can use the [Github Actions](/qbittorrent-nox-static/github-actions) to build the project by forking the repository.

## Bootstrapping the container

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Notes" label="Notes">

Some notes on the dockers method:

- The script installs the necessary dependencies so there is no docker file needed.
- We use a subdirectory `qbt`, not your `$HOME` directory, to avoid `.bashrc` and `.profile` conflicts.
- A subdirectory is automatically created, named `qbt` by the use of `-v $HOME/qbt:/root`
- The default path will be `HOME/qbt` outside the docker container and `/root/qbt` inside it.
- We use `-e "LANG=C.UTF-8"` with Debian based images to avoid some UTF errors.

:::tip[env file]
You do not need to configure the env while bootstrapping the container. It can be done after via the `.qbt_env` file or exporting them.

There are multiple ways to pass an env file when using Docker.

- You can use the `--env-file` switch when creating the docker and provide a file with your [envs](/qbittorrent-nox-static/build-help#env-settings).
- If a `.qbt_env` file is found in the same directory as the script, it will be used automatically.
- Using ENV in a dockerfile is also possible.

The easist method is the `.qbt_env` as the script has support flags for this purpose.

To bootstrap the container:

```bash
docker run -it -w /root -p 8080:8080 -v ~/qbt:/root alpine:edge /bin/ash -c 'apk update && apk add bash curl && bash'
```

If you need to download the script use this command

```bash
curl -sLO usrdx.github.io/s/qbt.bash && chmod +x qbt.bash
```

To bootstrap the container:

```bash
docker run -it -w /root -p 8080:8080 -e "LANG=C.UTF-8" -v ~/qbt:/root debian:latest /bin/bash -c 'apt update && apt install -y curl && bash'
