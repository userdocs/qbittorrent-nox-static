From releases after the 03/10/2024 you can use the `artifact_attestations` to verify the provenance of the build.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds

Using `gh` cli you can use this command to verify the provenance of the build:

For example, using the `x86_64-qbittorrent-nox` build:

```bash
gh attestation verify x86_64-qbittorrent-nox -o userdocs
```
